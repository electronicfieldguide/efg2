1. The Directory structure

ource code,deployment and installation guide etc)

b)efgRDB same as (a) above but with a Relational Database backend. 
At this point, our application only 
works when you import data into a relational database using our import code.
We intend to fix that in our next release.
You can implement our interfaces and use your own Database if you do not intend to use our code.
(Kimmy edit this..Don't know what to really say)

c)fedSchema. Contains darwin2.xsd and digir.xsd used by our application to aid in the processing
of DiGIR requests and responses using darwin core as our federation schema.
Currently we require that we have these files physically located in this directory. In future we intend
to read these files from remote locations.

d) lib. Contains jar files required to run our application.

e)metadata:  Contains xml files that have metadata information for each dataSource. Infact after every importation of a 
dataSource, a metadata file should be created and placed in this directory.

f) public_html; Contains files required to run efg.

g)source : contains source code that will be used in this application. If you do not intend to use any of our code for
ObjectStore(see efgOStore directory) or for Relational Databases (see efgRDB directory) you will have to implement all
of the interfaces located in source/project/efg/efgInterface

g) tests: Contains DiGIR request, inventory and metadata sample files.
Also contain DigirClient.java which can be used to tests the application against some of these files
on the command line.
