The .xml files in this directory are needed to generate castor
sources and jar files efg2.

To generate jar files (which is neeeded by efg2)
execute ant on buildAllCastor.xml with no targets

To generate only the sources for your view/use
execute ant on buildAllCastor.xml with the
"generatesrcs" target.

You may want to edit generate.properties to suit you.

Generated jar files are placed in the right folder for efg2
use.
Only use this when the schema for each changes.

You can also generate jar files for each of the build files
by executing the "generate" target on each individual file.

buildTemplates.xml is used to generate src files for handling 
templates in efg2

generateEFGDocument.xml is used to generate src files for handling
the xml generated by efg2.

generateSearchableDocument.xml is used to generate src files that
can output the searchable "characters" for each datasource.
