Handling SQL Keywords

	Sql keywords in field names are handled by 
	appending an '_' to the name.

Field Names	
	The field names in efg2 are caseinsensitive.
	An error is thrown if field names are duplicated.
	Field names that start with numbers are re-mapped to
	a random number preceded by the string 'efg'
