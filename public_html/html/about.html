        This website was originally developed by 
        <A HREF="http://www.cs.umb.edu">Computer Science</A> students 
	at <A HREF="http://www.umb.edu">University Of Massachusetts 
	Boston</A>, as their final project for a Software Engineering 
	course. <A HREF="http://www.cs.umb.edu/~ram">Dr. Robert Morris</A> 
	was the project advisor and guide.  Their client for this project 
	was Dr. Robert Stevenson from the Biology department, also at 
	UMass Boston.
      </P>
      <P>
        The students involved in the project were Daniel Keefe, 
	Margaret Metcalf, Monisha Prakash, Dai Wu and Fang Yu.
      </P>
      <P>
        Dr. Morris and Dr. Stevenson followed up on the project and
	obtained an NSF grant to further the development of the Electronic
	Field Guide.  <A HREF="http://www.cs.umb.edu/~mpassell">
	Matthew Passell</A>, a graduate student in Computer Science at 
	UMass Boston has completely overhauled the system, which is
	primarily written in Java.  So far, William Haber, a researcher, 
	has provided us with valuable text data and images of butterflies
	and plants of Costa Rica.
