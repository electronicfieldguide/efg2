Using Fonts:

1. Create a fonts directory
2. Copy all .tff,.otf,.ttc,.afm files that you would like 
to use into this folder
3. This folder must be accesible to your web server(Tomcat).
You can even create this directory under Tomcat

4. Open efg Importer and select the set Fonts directory option
5. The efg2 Importer must be able to copy files to your server
6. Click on the configure fonts option
to indicate which fonts you want embedded in pdf
7. Click OK, a configuration file will be copied to your server

For Advanced users edit pdfPlateFonts.xml
and set embedded to true for the fonts that
you want embedded.
Note that there may be licensing issues involved and it is 
your responsibility to make sure that the fonts you embed are
correctly licensed.

Also note that the fonts you select will be made available
on the user interface for the plate maker

Restart Tomcat every time you make changes to the configuration file
