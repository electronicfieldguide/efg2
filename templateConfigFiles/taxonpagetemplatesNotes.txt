Solanaceae Data(1) -> Family, Ith, palm,EFGCR,Ipo
HetData

Make the thing called 'A' look the same as the thing.

Write templates and say that the thing that is called 'Common Name' replace with the thing that is called 'Family Common Name'

And so on..
There may be some slight problems but perhaps we can deal with them when they happen.

Convention for naming things in jsp template pages

group : group id : group rank:character rank 
'gl':group id : group rank
'cl':groupid:group rank:character rank
 
if group rank the same means use it to sort characterValues

Use this to sort groups into characterValue ranks
	<group rank="1" id="1">
				<characterValue rank="1" text="Field Guide to the Bogs of Southern New England"/>
				<characterValue rank="2" text="by Marsha Salett"/>
			</group>

group:1:1:1
group:1:1:2
Distinguish between a group label and a characterLabel
<group rank="2" id="2" label="Taxonomy">
				<groups>
					<group rank="1" id="3">
						<characterValue rank="1" value="Common Name"/>
						<characterValue rank="2"/>
						<characterValue rank="3"/>
						<characterValue rank="4" value="Genus"/>
						<characterValue rank="5" value="Species"/>
						<characterValue rank="6" value="Author"/>
						<characterValue rank="7" value="Family"/>
						<characterValue rank="8" value="Family Common Name"/>
					</group>
					<group rank="2" id="4">
						<characterValue rank="1" value="Main Image"/>
					</group>
				</groups>
			</group>

group:2:2:1:select=CommonName
group:2:2:1:label='SomeText' een

Differentiate between labels and text..
